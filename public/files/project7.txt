I'm not sure why I made this, or the thought process while going through it, but I have to admit it is very pretty. The origional video was a slowed down version, but I couldnt find it and I no longer have the computer that had the project file - vary sad.

Its kind of ironic that this, maybe a day or two worth of work, looks better than a lot of the stuff I spend weeks on.
