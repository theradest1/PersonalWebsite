I use this bot in just about every server based project if I want to update it while at school - my school has VNC servers blocked so I can't remote into my raspberry pi - hence this

some things it can do (all with discord commands):
- start a server
- stop a server
- restart a server
- git commands such as pull and push
- quick command replace makes it easy to adapt to other projects
