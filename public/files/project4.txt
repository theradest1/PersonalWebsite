This was my absolute first Unity project, and my first actual attempt at a 3D game. I chose to make a 3D version of pac-man that ended up being more of a horror game where you are running from the ghosts. I considered going back and fixing it up, but one look at that code and I knew I would have to re-write the whole thing - yikes.
