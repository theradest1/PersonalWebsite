This is my 3D Unity mutliplayer plugin that is very versitile and fits in almost any situation.

I ended up creating a better version using the UDP protocol but is still very similar to how this one works

Here are some features:
 - Takes and gives player position, rotation, and velocity (3D)
 - configurable update rate (automaticly conforming player smoothing)
 - extremly efficient - I couldnt get to a max player amount before my pc couldnt handle the amount of unity projects open
 - Handles 3D sound very easly
 - Anything not added can be added with the event system

Things I plan to add:
 - an option to create rooms with a max player amount
 - TCP and UDP protocalls instead of http
 - security
 - everything can always be more efficient
