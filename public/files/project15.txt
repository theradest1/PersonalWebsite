This is a 3D scan I made by taking a lot of photos of my engineering teacher's head, fixing up in blender (remeshing, smoothing, patching) and then 3D printing it. The main thing I learned from this is don't try and 3D scan something that is shiny (like my teachers head) or it will mess a lot of things up.
