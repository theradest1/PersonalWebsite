By far the most polished game I have made: a first person shooter that is very focused on movement and countering other classes/weapons

Github project: <a>https://github.com/theradest1/movementFPS</a>

A bit about the server/backend:
- uses UDP protocol
- server is made in javascript (Node with Dgram)
- can run at 32 ticks/sec with 4 players on a raspberry pi
- can run at 128 ticks/sec with 4 or more players on a PC (as fast as the most competitive FPSs right now)
- has a dynamic tick rate: if high latency or the server is struggling the tickrate will lower automatically
- event based
- almost fully client-processed: the server really only carries messages along while the clients decode and execute those events
- multi-message sending is supported
- quick balancing: you can change small class/weapon stats and it will update instantly without having to re-build the game

Gameplay:
- really fun to play with friends (my friends and I play during lunch)
- very openended movement to make the skill ceiling higher
- multiple classes that purposfully counter eachother
- many weapons along with grenades and flashes
- some cool maps
- a replay system that shows how you died
- player animations
- absolutly everything was made by me (some maps made by friend)
